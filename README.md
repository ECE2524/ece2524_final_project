Asylum Amnesia

This project is a text based adventure game.  The player wakes up in an asylum with no memory and must figure out
what events have happened by exploring rooms and using objects to solve puzzles.  We may also implement a combat
system in our game.

One design philosophy we look to follow is the Rule of Modularity.  We plan to write the game in a way so that it
can be expanded in the future.  For example, the game will output text, but by using different modules for the
game algorithm and the game text interface, a GUI could easily be added over top of the game in the future to 
enhance the user experience.  Also, by making the program modular, it will make the task of programming less of a
headache because it is much easier to work with several small modules as opposed to one large module that contains
all of the program's code.
